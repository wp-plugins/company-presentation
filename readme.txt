We are using bootstrap framework, which unfortunately uses very simple and frequently used classnames eg. "row", "col" and "container". This produces problems with some themes, that also uses these classnames.
In order to solve this problem, we have been looking for a way to isolate our plugin css or maybe quit bootstrap.
